Business rules:
1. Not to add duplicate products to list
2. Add product quantity
3. Introduce product importance in the list
4. Implement list sorting according product importance
5. Permanently store created products list
   and load it on program startup
6. Add possibility to create different shopping lists
   Introduce shopping list title - must be unique
   across all user lists
7. Add possibility to manage shopping lists:
   implement CRUD for shopping lists
8. Introduce shopping list archive for deleted/used lists
9.

Next steps:
Lesson 2:
0. Single Responsibility Principle
1. Implement each menu step in separate class
2. Introduce Command design pattern
3. Introduce Strategy design pattern
4. Introduce three layer application architecture:
   UI, Business Logic, Data Access Layer

Lesson 3:
5. Rename commands to views - they represent UI layer.
6. Introduce data validation on business logic side.
   Business Rule: when you add product to the list,
   product title is required, must not be null or empty.
   Product description can be omitted.
7. Introduce Request/Response to business logic.
   When business logic can return different results,
   for example request processed, or bunch of errors, then
   Request/Response object is a good practice to encapsulate
   requests and responses to business logic.
8. Treat business logic component like a service (separate autonomous
   part of the system who will implement user use case).
   Send request to service, service process request (check all
   business rules, do technical stuff like store data to db, etc.)
   and send back response with call results.

9. Introduce database, SQL, JDBC API, DAL implementation
10.Implement 2,3,4,5 business rules,
   focus on incremental development process

Lesson 4:
11. Discuss db integration step by step
12. Show how to write integration tests
13. Switch application from InMemory database to real database integration
14. Improve JDBC code if possible
15. Introduce Request object to business logic
16. Introduce acceptance tests, show how to test app without UI,
using only request/response to business logic


Lesson 5:
17. Implement Business Rule: User can create different shopping lists.
    Each shopping list must have unique title.
18. Think about domain model design. Introduce ShoppingList entity.
    Discuss shopping list and product relations and how to implement them.
19. Implement CRUD operations for Shopping List entity.
20. IoC, Business Logic implementation, split to small classes and services
21. application.properties file and how to inject properties to code @Value




Lesson 6:
Introduce Servlet API
Introduce Command design pattern for Business Logic layer


Lesson 7:
Introduction to ORM, Hibernate, JPA

Lesson 8:
ORM, Hibernate, JPA relations

Lesson 9:
HTML, CSS, simple Spring MVC introduction, UI implementation

Lesson 10:
HTML, CSS, simple Spring MVC introduction, UI implementation
